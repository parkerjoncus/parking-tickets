<p><b>Project Highlights</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Generated a new duplicate dataset containing every duplicate ticket from the original dataset</li>
<li>Duplicates are defined as: Same License Plate + Same Day + Same Violation</li>
<li>Added a new feature to uniquely identify duplicate groups</li>
<li>Added a new feature to identify first and repeat tickets within each duplicate group</li>
<li>Total excess fines issued by the City of Chicago: $37,198,820</li>
<li>Total number of repeats issued since 1996: 643,446</li>
<li>Total excess paid on repeat tickets: $28,288,495</li>
<li>Total excess paid on repeat expired registration tickets: $5,634,383</li>
<li>Identification of the officers who have issued the highest number of repeat tickets</li>
<li>Created multiple linear regression models to predict the number of expired plate duplicate tickets in each ward based on demographic, health, and socioeconomic data.</li>
<li>Used the regerssion models to find what factors are statistcally significant in determining ticket counts within wards and if the factors positively or negativly affect the ticket counts</li>
<li>Found that while race may not be the reason why people get more or less tickets, there is a difference in the magnitude at which different races are ticketed.</li>
